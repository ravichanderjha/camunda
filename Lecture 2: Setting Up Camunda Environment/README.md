**Java Camunda - Lecture 2: Setting Up Camunda Environment**

**Installing and Configuring Camunda BPM:**
In this lecture, we will walk through the process of installing and configuring Camunda BPM on your development environment. We'll explore different installation options, such as downloading the standalone distribution or using the Camunda Spring Boot Starter, which simplifies the setup process. We'll cover the necessary steps to set up Camunda, including:

1. **Downloading Camunda:** Obtaining the Camunda BPM distribution suitable for your needs, whether it's the standalone web application or the embedded version with Spring Boot.

2. **Installation:** Installing Camunda on your local machine or deploying it to a server or cloud environment.

3. **Configuration:** Configuring Camunda to connect to the required databases and external systems. We'll explore the configuration files and settings that allow you to customize Camunda to fit your specific use case.

**Integrating Camunda with Java Development Environments:**
Next, we will learn how to integrate Camunda with popular Java development environments like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. We'll explore the available Camunda plugins and extensions for these IDEs that enhance the development experience. We'll cover:

1. **Camunda Modeler Plugin:** Installing and utilizing the Camunda Modeler plugin for creating and editing BPMN diagrams directly within the IDE.

2. **Camunda Cockpit Integration:** Exploring how to connect your IDE to the Camunda Cockpit for monitoring and managing processes.

3. **Camunda Tasklist Integration:** Integrating your development environment with the Camunda Tasklist for handling user tasks during process development.

**Deploying Camunda Runtime and Database Setup:**
In this section, we will focus on deploying Camunda runtime in various environments. We'll discuss:

1. **Deployment Options:** Different approaches to deploying Camunda, such as running it in standalone mode, deploying it as a web application in an application server (e.g., Apache Tomcat), or embedding it within a Spring Boot application.

2. **Database Setup:** Configuring Camunda to use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2) for persistence. We'll learn how to set up the required database tables and schemas for Camunda to store process data.

3. **Connection Pooling:** Optimizing database connectivity using connection pooling mechanisms.

**Setup Example:**

1. Go to https://start.camunda.com/ initialize and download camunda project as given in example

2. review application.yaml configuration
