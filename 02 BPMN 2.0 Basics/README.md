**Java Camunda - BPMN 2.0 Basics**

In this section, we will dive into the fundamentals of BPMN 2.0 and learn how to model business processes using BPMN elements with Camunda. We will also explore the Camunda Modeler tool, which is a powerful graphical tool for creating and editing BPMN diagrams. This will allow us to design executable business processes and workflows that can be seamlessly integrated with Java applications using Camunda.

**BPMN 2.0 Overview:**

BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) is a widely adopted standard for visualizing business processes. It provides a graphical notation that is easy to understand by both business stakeholders and technical teams. BPMN 2.0 enables the representation of complex processes using simple symbols, making it an effective tool for process modeling and communication.

**Camunda Modeler:**

Camunda Modeler is a user-friendly desktop application that allows you to create, edit, and validate BPMN, CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation), and DMN (Decision Model and Notation) diagrams. It provides an intuitive interface for designing process flows and integrating decision models.

**Example Project:**

Let's create a simple Java project that demonstrates BPMN 2.0 basics using Camunda. We will model a vacation approval process, where employees submit vacation requests, and managers approve or reject those requests.

**Step 1: Setup Camunda Project**

1. Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
2. Add the necessary Camunda dependencies to your project, such as the Camunda Engine and Camunda Model API.

**Step 2: Design the BPMN Diagram**

Open the Camunda Modeler and create a new BPMN diagram:

1. Start Event: Representing the start of the process. Name it "StartVacationRequest."
2. User Task: Representing the vacation request submission. Name it "Submit Vacation Request."
3. User Task: Representing the vacation request approval. Name it "Approve Vacation Request."
4. Exclusive Gateway: To make an approval decision based on conditions. Name it "Approval Decision."
5. Sequence Flows: Connect the elements in the right order, i.e., Start Event → Submit Vacation Request → Approval Decision → Approve Vacation Request.
6. End Event: Representing the end of the process. Name it "Vacation Request Processed."

The BPMN diagram will look like this:

```
StartVacationRequest ---> Submit Vacation Request ---> Approval Decision --[Approved]--> Approve Vacation Request ---> Vacation Request Processed
                  \                      /
                   --[Rejected]---------/
```

**Step 3: Implement the Process in Java**

Now, we will integrate the BPMN diagram into the Java project using Camunda's Java API.

1. Create a new Java class named `VacationRequestProcess` and define the process logic.
2. Use the Camunda Java API to start the process instance when a vacation request is submitted.
3. Implement a service task for handling the vacation approval decision logic.
4. Implement a service task for notifying employees about the approval/rejection status.

**Step 4: Run the Project**

Run the Java project and deploy the BPMN diagram to the Camunda Engine. Trigger the process by creating a new vacation request. Observe how the process flows based on the approval decision and completes when approved or rejected.

Congratulations! You've successfully mastered the BPMN 2.0 basics with Camunda by modeling a simple vacation approval process and integrating it into a Java application. Now you can extend your knowledge to model more complex business processes and leverage the full capabilities of Camunda to automate and optimize your workflows.
